# Evan King's Website
This is the source code for my personal website, [evanking.ca](https://evanking.ca).
It is built with a stack of Pug, CSS, JavaScript, and Parcel. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and deployed using an Actions workflow you can see on the [Actions](https://github.com/evankingca/evanking-website/actions/workflows/deploy-with-gulp.yml) page.
