# Evan King's Website
This is the source code for my personal website, [evanking.ca](https://evanking.ca).
It is built with a stack of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and gulp.js. Gulp handles building the SCSS, inserting templates into the HTML, and moving directories around for publishing. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and deployed using an Actions workflow you can see on the [Actions](https://github.com/evankingca/evanking-website/actions/workflows/deploy-with-gulp.yml) page.
